User Manual for Sample Size Determination Using Percentile-Based Confidence Intervals
The script is designed for benthic research planning. Based on an existing dataset, it can predict how many samples need to be collected at a new site to achieve results with a specified precision level. This program analyzes how measurement precision (confidence interval width) changes with increasing sample size across three significance levels (70%, 90%, 95%). The primary output calculates the number of samples needed to achieve specified precision targets.
❗ Important Method Limitation:
This percentile-based method yields reliable estimates only when the required number of sampling replicates does not exceed half of your original dataset's sampling effort. For studies demanding more replicates than this threshold, the method will progressively underestimate sampling requirements.
